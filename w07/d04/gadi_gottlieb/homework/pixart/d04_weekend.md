##### Step 1
- When I click the "Set Color" button, it should change the color of the "brush" box to the color I specify in the input field.

##### Step 2
- Using JavaScript, create 20 divs of the "square" class and append them to the body

##### Step 4
- Add functionality so that when I click on each "square", it changes the color of that individual square to "green"

##### Step 5
- Modify your code so that when I click on each "square", it changes to the color I set using my input instead of "green" every time.

##### Step 6
- Modify the CSS so that the "square" class has a height and width of 10px and a margin of 0.
- Modify your code so that you are creating 8000 divs instead of 20.
- Change the event that changes your box colors from 'click' to 'mouseover'
- Paint a picture!

## Bonus
- Add a color swatch. You should have 3 boxes with the most recent 3 colors used. When you click on each of those boxes, it should set the current brush color back to that color.
