Homework 11-04/05

#### Learning Objectives
- Practice building a single model Backbone application
- Deploying a Backbone application to Heroku
- Start researching for project 3
* Research topics for your self-learning exercise.
- Suggest topics P3 mini-lessons


## Part 1

Start by reading the Fundamentals section and Backbone Basics section of
[Developing Backbone.js
Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/). Take notes on
each individual component of a Backbone app and its function. Make notes on how
these components all work together and how Events are used to keep your
application components all in sync.

## Part 2 - CHALLENGE! - My Suite Blargh

Using your notes only as a reference try to build a Blog in Backbone from
memory. Your app can be as simple or as complicated as you would like but should
have at least:

- a List View - Displaying all
- a Show View - Displaying one entry
- a Router to maintain state

Your app can have either a Rails Back-End or a Sinatra Back-End. You decide!

This is meant to be an exercise for you to really solidify the concepts you've
learned this week in an expressive way. You are free to do whatever you want
(mostly)!

When your blog is complete, DEPLOY! Host your app on Heroku, send us the link to
your blog, and add an entry. Your entry should be a technical blog post
(detailing code, a specific feature's implementation, etc.) or a general post
(related to your experience with backbone, resources you used to create the
blog, etc).

_Suggestion_: I would suggest doing the reading a couple hours/a day prior to
attempting to build the app. Let that suite, suite knowledge sink into your
brain before you start to code.

## Part 3 - Research for P3

Start thinking about potential ideas for your third project. Use some of the
skills and ideas you heard about from Cat and Rashida about UX and the early
stages of project research.

- Do some user research
  - talk to people
  - see if they like your idea
  - what problems do they have with an existing service?
- Do some feature research
  - what would people want from your site
  - what features would be beneficial and useful to implement
  - what features are needed for the MVP
- user stories
  - start jotting down potential user stories
  - start filling your Trello backlog
  - share us on these boards!
- research technologies you might want to use

## Part 4 - Research Topics for Self-Directed Study

Monday morning we will hit the ground running with our self-directed studies, so
come prepared with a list of topics that you are interested in.

We suggest you work with at least 1 other person, and will give everyone time
to find teammates interested in the same topic Monday morning. But, to be
effective/efficient you should come with topics in mind.


## Part 5 - P3 Mini-Lessons
Let us know what you guys want to cover during P3, we have some ideas for potential topics, but this last week is for you! This doesn't have to be a new topic, it could be another pass at anything we've covered during the past 11 weeks.
