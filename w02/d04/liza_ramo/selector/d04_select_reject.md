# The Select Method

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Define a method that will accept one parameter, a limit, and utilize
the Ruby `select` method to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
