### Questions from GoT_refactored
#### .rspec file
* Do we need to create these .rspec files when we are working to be able to control how the rspec tests display in terminal? (I noticed that the file I was working on earlier today for GoT didn't have one of these - I was trying to color code my rspec test results and didn't know how to do that..)

####battle.rb
* I don't think I understand this file? The spec sheet is pretty empty compared to the army_spec.rb one. But why? Do we not need to run any tests?
* Is the battle.rb doc ALL one method? Why do these things not need to be broken up into multiple actions?

####app.rb
* If we created all of these instances of people, etc. here in app.rb - why do we need to recreate them in army_spec.rb? Is there no way to pull from this existing dataset?
