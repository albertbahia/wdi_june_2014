1. In the Army Specs, why do we cut off the word members
on line 22 and 23 when we are creating a new army?
When we created the north army, we called
it north_members. Why the cutoff of members?

2. Most of this code calls on parent files.
Seeing the full picture is slightly difficult.
I understand why refactoring single code is good,
but wouldn't it better to have all of your code in one file
where you can just scroll down into it and fix it up?
The constant moving from one file to another gets confusing.
