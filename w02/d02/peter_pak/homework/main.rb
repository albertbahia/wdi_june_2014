# This assignment is designed to solidify your understanding of inheritance and testing. Also, this is a chance to test out your creativity chops. :wink:
#
# Specs
#
# Design and model a new problem domain. You problem domain should include at least three new classes.
# The first class you define should be the parent class
# The subsequent classes should inherit from that parent class
# Parent Class
#
# The parent class should:
#
# define at least 3 attributes that will be inherited by its children
# define at least 1 behavior that will be inherited by its children
# Child Classes
#
# Each child class should:
#
# Inherit at least 3 attributes and 1 behavior from its parent
# define at least 1 new attribute
# define at least 2 new behaviors
# Before defining any of your classes or writing any code you should write tests. No code should ever be written before there is a test for that code. Think about what you are testing and why you are testing it. Use the tests written for the GoT assignment to guide your test writing. Also look back at Better Specs (the reading from last night) for a reference when writing your tests. If you have not already, lookup an RSpec cheatsheet to see what types of different matchers are available to you when testing.
#
# Lastly, COMMIT after you write your tests, and COMMIT after you define the class to pass your tests. We will check your commit history to see the progression of your code.
