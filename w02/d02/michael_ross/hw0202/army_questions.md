How does .reduce(:+) method work in army_spec.rb?

Not quite a question per se, but I'm a little unclear about the attack method.  

How does one know how to extract test methods from problem modeling
and class methods from test specs?  
Is this simply a matter of being comfortable with Ruby
and extensive experience coupled with comprehensive problem modeling?  
How can one approach this systematically and efficiently?
