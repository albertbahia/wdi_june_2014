-- Questions --

I don't really have any questions. I looked at the army_spec file for a while and
I'm pretty sure that I understand it all. The only thing that I'm confused about
is how to make something pass the final test which uses the attack method, but
McKenneth and I already discussed this during our one on one today, so I'm sure
that it'll get cleared up in due time.
