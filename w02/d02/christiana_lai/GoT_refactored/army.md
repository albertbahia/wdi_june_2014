#W02D01 Homework
##Step 2
###Army class Questions
####army.rb
1. How is the "select" method used?
2. Why are we modifying the "reject" method with the bang?
3. Why do we have to use the "sample" method? And why is "sample" used twice? Sample attack their sample members?

####army_spec.rb
1. Why does the size expect to equal 4 when we added Arya?
2. For the Clear Bodies method, why are we restating all their stats? Why not array?
3. Why isn't Arya counted with the living members and the Dying North?

####battle.rb
1. What does temp do?

####battle_spec.rb
1. Why are there no specs? Is it because the all the necessary "battling" was done on army_spec.rb?
