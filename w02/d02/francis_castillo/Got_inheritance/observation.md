The test in army_spec based on my observation seemed a bit more complex than our previous examples which were a bit more straight forward. Some of the things that I observed was the creation of groups to interact.  Test had they been implemented as code first would have really unreadable because of all the actions happening in that class. Testing first now makes more sense because you can explore infinite possibilities.  Creating that tackles more problems than just one.
