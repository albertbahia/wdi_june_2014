re: Army Class

I understand most of the specs and the methods they are testing.

In the class file, here, I don't understand what the .sample method is doing. 
	"def attack(other_army)
    	living_members.sample.attack(other_army.living_members.sample)
  	end"


I am confused as to why you are using .times in the specs in the last two test examples, and I am can't figure out what the 
 "(&:symbol)"
notation is doing (even though I think I've copied it from stackoverflow before as part of a larger piece of code).

Other than that, I think I understand why all the parts of the class file and specs are there and what they are doing.
