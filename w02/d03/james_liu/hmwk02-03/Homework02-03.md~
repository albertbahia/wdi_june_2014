In a markdown file write the SQL commands you would use to retrieve the following information from your database. Test each command in PSQL to make sure it is correct:

- The average square footage of all offices.
-SELECT AVG(sq_footage) FROM offices;

- The total number of apartments.
-SELECT COUNT(*) FROM apartments;

- The apartments where there is no tenant
-SELECT * FROM apartments WHERE tenant = 0;

- The names of all of the companies
-SELECT company_name FROM offices;

- The number of cubicles and bathrooms in the 3rd office
-SELECT COALESCE(number_of_cubes,0) + COALESCE(number_of_baths,0) FROM offices WHERE office_number = 3;

- The storefronts that have kitchens
-SELECT * FROM storefronts WHERE kitchen = 'Yes';

- The storefront with the highest square footage and outdoor seating
-SELECT * FROM storefronts WHERE outdoor_seating = 'Yes' AND sq_footage = (SELECT MAX(sq_footage) FROM storefronts WHERE outdoor_seating = 'Yes');

- The office with the lowest number of cubicles
- SELECT * FROM offices WHERE number_of_cubes = (SELECT MIN(number_of_cubes) FROM offices);

- The office with the most cubicles and bathrooms
SELECT * FROM offices WHERE (number_of_cubes = (SELECT MAX(number_of_cubes) FROM offices)) AND (number_of_baths = (SELECT MAX(number_of_baths) FROM offices));
