# HAMco Towers
Your assignment for this weekend is to get some more practice with writing flexible, tested, robust code.

#### Step 1 - Model
Model your classes and think about the attributes and behaviors your objects will have. Look at your specs and let that guide you. Before you touch a single line of code, run the specs and watch them fail!

#### Step 2 - Test, Code, Commit, Repeat
###### Building
- a name
- an address
- a number of floors

###### Apartment
- a floor
- a name
- a price
- a square footage
- a number of bedrooms
- a number of bathrooms

###### Tenants
- a name
- an age
- a gender

I have provided starter specs and stubs for tests that you have to fill in for the following behavior:

- List info for a tenant
- Info for an apartment
- Listing the tenants of an apartment with tenant info
- Adding a tenant to an apartment
- List a building's apartments with apartment info
- Rent a building's apartment to a tenant

Make a commit once you complete each class


#### Step 3 - Self-Learning
__MANDATORY__

Read the documentation for [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html). Write down any questions that you have.
- What is an ORM?
- Why would we use an ORM?
- What is convention over configuration?
