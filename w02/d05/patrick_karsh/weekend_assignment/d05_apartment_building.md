- Self-Learning

# HAMco Towers
Your assignment for this weekend is to get some more practice with writing flexible, tested, robust code.

#### Step 1 - Model
Model your classes and think about the attributes and behaviors your objects will have. Look at your specs and let that guide you. Before you touch a single line of code, run the specs and watch them fail!

#### Step 2 - Test, Code, Commit, Repeat
###### Building
- a name
- an address
- a number of floors

###### Apartment
- a floor
- a name
- a price
- a square footage
- a number of bedrooms
- a number of bathrooms

###### Tenants
- a name
- an age
- a gender

I have provided starter specs and stubs for tests that you have to fill in for the following behavior:

- List info for a tenant
- Info for an apartment
- Listing the tenants of an apartment with tenant info
- Adding a tenant to an apartment
- List a building's apartments with apartment info
- Rent a building's apartment to a tenant

Make a commit once you complete each class


#### Step 3 - Self-Learning
__MANDATORY__

Read the documentation for [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html). Write down any questions that you have.
- What is an ORM?

Object Relational Mapping. It is a method for retriving bojects from a databases.  

- Why would we use an ORM?

It allows your ruby code to interact with your SQL database. 

- What is convention over configuration?

Convention over configuration is a way of coding that keeps you from having to write an inordinate amount of configuration code. This is because you write things in the same way on every possible ocassion and only write configuration code for where it was absolutely necesary to deviate from convention.
