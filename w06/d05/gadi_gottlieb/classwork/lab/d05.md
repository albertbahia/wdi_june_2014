# Calculator

#### Learning Objectives
- Gain comfortability coding in a new language
- Practice working with arrays in JavaScript
- Practice defining functions in Javascript
- Practice passing functions stored in variables

To get more comfortability and practice with our new friend JavaScript we are going to build a simple calculator.
There's a hitch...you can only use the `+` operator, the `-` operator, or a function that you have defined yourself.
Assume all input values will be integers.

# Part 1
### Subtract
- write a function that will accept two parameters and return the result of performing subtraction on those two values.

### Times
- write a function that will accept two parameters and return the result of performing multiplication on those two values.

### Divided
- write a function that will accept two parameters and perform integer division on those two numbers, i.e. divideBy(5, 4) should return 1, divideBy(5, 22) should return 0

# Part 2 - Partner

### Factorial
- write a function that will accept a single parameter, a number, and will return the factorial result of that number

### Power
- write a function that will accept two parameters (a base and an exponent) and will return the result of raising the base to the exponent.
