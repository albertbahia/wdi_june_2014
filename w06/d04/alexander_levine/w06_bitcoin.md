# Bitcoin

Create a sinatra server with a single route, the `/` root route. When a user visits the root route the current Bitcoin exhange rates in Dollars, Pounds, and Euros should be displayed. There should also be a link that when clicked will refresh the results and display the most up-to-date exchange rates.

Use the [Coindesk API](http://www.coindesk.com/api/) to get this information.

__PRO-TIP__: Take a few minutes to read through their API documentation. How do you gain access to their API? What are the necessary parameters, API keys? What type of response can you expect back?
