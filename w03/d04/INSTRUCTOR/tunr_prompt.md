# Tun.r 1.0

Today your goal is to finish building Tun.r 1.0 using Sinatra.

We've completed the CRUD interface for artists, so you'll focus on building the
CRUD interface for songs and playlists.

## Songs
For songs, a user should be able to:
* view a list all songs
* view detailed information on a specific song
* add a new song (using the artist_id # to connect it to an artist)
* edit an existing song
* delete a song

## Playlists
For playlists, a user should be able to:
* view a list of all playlists
* view a specific playlist (the songs on it)
* add a new playlist
* add songs to an existing playlist
* remove songs from an existing playlist
* delete a playlist

## Bonus
Add MORE features to Tun.r. Be creative and do whatever you want!

If you need some ideas, though, here are a few:
* Use a select box of artist names instead of artist_id when adding/editing
  songs.
* Use [HTML5 Audio](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp) tag to embed
  an audio player (for the preview url) next to every song.
* Add some style using CSS
