###### WDI June 2014 - Closure

# Project 3 Presentations

### Tuesday, September 4, 2014

**Code freeze: 11:59pm, September 3, 2014**

## Format

* Project presentations should be 8 minutes long + 4 minutes for questions. That is not much time, so make sure to streamline your presentations.
* Ensure that your up-to-date application is deployed to Heroku
* Ensure that your Trello board is up to date
* Ensure that your README is complete
* During presentations, your laptop should not be open, unless you are on deck to present.

Recall the 4 sections that serve as guidelines to structure your presentation.

| Section       | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Intro         | Tell us in a few sentences what your app does, and why you chose to build it |
| Demo          | A short (1 min) demonstration of the key features of your application |
| Creativity    | Show us one thing that you are proud of (let's see the code!) |
| Discernment   | Tell us about one thing that did not go well (how did you handle it?) |
| Follow-up     | What are your next steps for this project? |
