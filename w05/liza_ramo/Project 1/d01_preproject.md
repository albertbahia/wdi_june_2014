# Review

If you have not completed the MovieTrailer App and the World Cup Fever App, then do so tonight. Submit an updated pull request for the work you complete tonight. Your app should have at the very least CRUD functionality. If there was something that you were unsure of then make sure that you look at the solutions that have been posted, and use that as a guide to complete the functionality of your app. It is important that you understand the concepts covered on these two assignments before beginning work on your project.
