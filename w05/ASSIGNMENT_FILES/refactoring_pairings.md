# Refactoring Project 1

## Before You Begin
Push the lastest copy of your project to GitHub, so we can give you the most
accurate feedback possible.

## Pair Refactoring Excercise

For this exercise, we will be refactoring our first projects. You should NOT add
any features. Instead, you should just focus on improving code quality. Refer to
the hamSTACHE guidelines. VERY MINOR changes in functionality are acceptable if
they are required to make an improvement in code quality.

We will refactor our projects by pair programming with a partner.

You can use any pair programming technique / style that you'd like, including:
* Driver/Navigator
* Ping/Pong (A Write tests, B makes them pass, repeat)
* Ping/Pong Alternating (A Write tests, B makes them pass, then flip)

Note: Just because you're working on A's project, doesn't mean A has to be the
driver for driver/navigator.

You have until 5:00pm, and you should spend equal amounts of time on your
project and your partner's. You may divide this time however you like, i.e. you
can do 1 hour blocks alternating between projects, or you can do 3 hour blocks.
