###### WDI June 2014 - Closure

# Project 1 Presentations

### Tuesday, July 15, 2014

## Description

We will take Tuesday to pause our work on our projects and share where we are
at with the rest of the class. Remember, this is not the last time you will work on your project.

## Format

* Project presentations should be 10 minutes long  + 5 minutes for questions. That is not much time, so make sure to streamline your presentations.
* You will be able to hook up to the projector to demo your project and show us code. You are not required to have a slide deck for the rest of your presentation.
* Ensure that your up-to-date application is deployed to Heroku
* Ensure that your Trello board is up to date
* Ensure that your README is complete
* During presentations, your laptop should not be open, unless you are on deck to present.
* You are granted **two questions** for the entirety of the presentations. This is because we have to stick to a very tight time schedule, so use your questions wisely!

| Section       | Description |
